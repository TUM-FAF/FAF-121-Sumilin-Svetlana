Programming Style Guideline
==================

The style for writing is CamelCase.

**The name of variables: **
*	document their meaning
*	start with lower case 
*	variables with short scope have short names (i, j, m, n)

**The name of functions**
*	document their use
*	start with capital letter

**Statements**
*	variables should not be reused(reduce chance of error from misunderstood definition)
*	related variables of the same type can be declared in a common statement
*	unrelated variables should not be declared in the same statement

**General**
*	making names pronounceable
*	names are written in English
*	use parentheses
*	use indentation(size 4 (Visual Studio default))
*	lines split at graceful points(align the new line with previous lines)
*	short single statement if, for or while statements can be written in one line
*	a line of code should contain only one executable statement
*	use of white spaces
*	surround =, -, +, | by spaces
*	commas followed by a space
*	#define will be written all uppercase
