Laboratory Work â„–2
==================

It is 4102. Aliens invaded us. Luckily the world has some great engineers and you are one of 
them! Your'e working on an unbeatable weapon: Simulatron. Simulatron is an exact copy of 
alien ship but it has a secret: when the alien gets into ship the alien is traped and brought into 
human prison. Your task is very simple: you have to clone Simulatron's control panel. World 
depends on you...
