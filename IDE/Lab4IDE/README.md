Laboratory Work â„–4
==================
Web development 

First I Installed VMware Workstation for Ubuntu.
Installed rails: $ gem install rails

Created my new Application: $ rails new blog
Made my Application server running: $ rails server

I was checking my progress by navigating to: http://localhost:3000.

To make a hello page I used:  $ rails generate controller welcome index
and in index.html.erb file I have written my name.

Then I made it able to create some articles 
class ArticlesController < ApplicationController
  def new
  end
 
  def create
  end
end

And changed the article model:
$ rails generate model Article title:string text:text

And made it to be possible to save the articles
@article.save
  redirect_to @article
end
